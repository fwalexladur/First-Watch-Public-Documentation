# Introduction and Overview

The **First Watch® Platform** is an industrial cybersecurity solution designed to provide
visibility, control, and protection for **Operational Technology (OT)** environments.

It is built to support critical infrastructure systems such as:
- Industrial control systems (ICS)
- SCADA environments
- Power generation and distribution
- Water treatment and manufacturing facilities

First Watch focuses on **deterministic security controls**, enabling organizations to
identify assets, monitor behavior, and prevent unauthorized actions without disrupting
operations.

## Purpose of the Platform

The primary purpose of the First Watch Platform is to:

- Discover and inventory OT assets
- Monitor activity across endpoints and control networks
- Detect and prevent unauthorized software execution
- Enforce security policies in real time
- Support compliance and audit requirements

Unlike traditional IT security tools, First Watch is specifically designed to operate
in **availability-sensitive environments**, where downtime or unexpected behavior
can have serious safety and operational consequences.

## Key Platform Components

The First Watch Platform consists of several integrated components that work together
to deliver layered protection:

- **Controller**  
  The centralized management component responsible for policy distribution,
  event aggregation, and system visibility.

- **ControlGuard™**  
  An endpoint protection agent deployed on Windows-based OT systems such as
  SCADA servers, HMIs, and engineering workstations.

- **PLC Guard™**  
  A protection component focused on safeguarding PLC logic, firmware integrity,
  and industrial communication flows.

Together, these components form a unified security framework for OT environments.

## Design Principles

The First Watch Platform is built on the following design principles:

- **Deterministic Enforcement**  
  Security decisions are based on explicit trust rules rather than behavioral guessing.

- **Operational Continuity**  
  Security controls are designed to minimize impact on production systems.

- **Visibility and Transparency**  
  All security-relevant events are logged and made visible to operators and administrators.

- **Scalability**  
  The platform supports both small deployments and large distributed environments.

## Intended Audience

This User Manual is intended for:

- OT operators and administrators
- Security engineers responsible for OT environments
- System integrators and trusted partners
- Auditors and compliance stakeholders

The manual focuses on **platform usage and configuration**.
Detailed engineering internals and deployment automation are documented separately
in restricted internal documentation.
