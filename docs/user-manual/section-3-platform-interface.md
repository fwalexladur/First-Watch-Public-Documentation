# Section 3 – Platform Interface Overview

## 3.1 Purpose of the User Interface

The **First Watch® Platform user interface** provides a centralized view of the monitored
OT environment and serves as the primary interaction point for operators,
administrators, and security personnel.

The interface is designed to:
- Provide immediate visibility into system status
- Enable efficient navigation across assets, agents, policies, and events
- Support operational decision-making without overwhelming the user
- Maintain consistency across different functional areas of the platform

All configuration, monitoring, and investigation activities are performed
through the platform interface.

## 3.2 Authentication and Access

Access to the First Watch Platform requires user authentication.
User permissions and available actions depend on the assigned access role.

After successful authentication, users are presented with the **Home Page**,
which acts as the entry point to all platform functionality.

User access rights and role configuration are described in detail
in **Section 8 – Administration and Settings**.

---

## 3.3 Home Page Overview

The **Home Page** provides a high-level summary of the current system state.
It is intended to give operators immediate situational awareness.

Typical information presented on the Home Page includes:
- Overall system health indicators
- Active alarms and recent events
- Agent connectivity and status
- Quick access to frequently used views

The Home Page does not require configuration and dynamically reflects
the current state of the environment.

---

## 3.4 Navigation Structure

The platform uses a consistent navigation model across all views.
Navigation elements are typically organized to allow quick access to:

- Assets
- Agents
- Policies
- Events and Alarms
- Reports
- Settings and Administration

Navigation elements remain consistent across screens to reduce
cognitive load and simplify daily operations.

---

## 3.5 Assets View

The **Assets** view provides access to all registered hardware,
software, and account assets.

From this view, users can:
- Browse and filter assets
- Inspect asset attributes and relationships
- Review asset-related events and alarms
- Access historical snapshots and activity records

Asset management concepts are described in detail
in **Section 4 – Assets**.

---

## 3.6 Agents View

The **Agents** view displays all deployed agents and their current status.

From this view, users can:
- Verify agent connectivity and health
- Review installed modules
- Inspect agent-specific events
- Identify agents requiring attention or maintenance

Agent-specific details are covered in
**Section 5 – Agents**.

---

## 3.7 Policies View

The **Policies** view provides centralized access to policy configuration
and policy deployment status.

Users can:
- Review active policies
- Track policy updates and changes
- Identify agents affected by policy modifications
- Manage temporary overrides (where permitted)

Policy concepts and usage are described in
**Section 6 – Policies**.

---

## 3.8 Events and Alarms View

The **Events and Alarms** view provides visibility into system activity
and security-relevant occurrences.

This view allows users to:
- Review real-time and historical events
- Identify alarms requiring investigation
- Filter events by asset, severity, or time
- Track acknowledgment and resolution status

Detailed event handling is described in
**Section 7 – Events and Alarms**.

---

## 3.9 Reports and Analytics

The platform provides reporting and export functionality
to support operational review and compliance activities.

Reports may include:
- Asset inventories
- Event summaries
- Alarm statistics
- Agent status reports

Reporting capabilities are accessible through the user interface
and reflect the current configuration and data scope.

---

## 3.10 Settings and Administration Access

Administrative functions are accessible through the **Settings**
or **Administration** areas of the interface.

These functions include:
- User and access management
- System-wide configuration
- License information
- Network and enterprise settings

Administrative topics are described in detail
in **Section 8 – Administration and Settings**.

---

## 3.11 Interface Design Considerations

The First Watch user interface is designed with OT operational constraints in mind:

- Clear separation between monitoring and configuration actions
- Minimal use of disruptive notifications
- Predictable navigation and consistent layout
- Focus on clarity rather than visual complexity

This design approach ensures that the interface remains usable
during both routine operations and incident response situations.
