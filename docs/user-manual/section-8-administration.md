# Section 8 – Administration and Settings

## 8.1 Purpose of Administration and Settings

The **Administration and Settings** area of the **First Watch® Platform**
provides centralized control over system-wide configuration,
user access, and operational parameters.

Administrative functions are designed to:
- Maintain secure and controlled access to the platform
- Configure global system behavior
- Support operational governance and compliance
- Ensure consistent platform operation across environments

Access to administrative functions is restricted
to authorized users based on assigned roles.

---

## 8.2 User and Access Management

The platform supports role-based access control
to ensure that users can perform only authorized actions.

Administrative users can:
- Create and manage user accounts
- Assign roles and permissions
- Control access to specific platform functions

Access management ensures separation of duties
between operators, administrators, and security personnel.

---

## 8.3 Roles and Permissions

Roles define the set of actions a user is allowed to perform
within the platform.

Typical role categories may include:
- Read-only or monitoring roles
- Operational roles
- Administrative roles

Permissions determine access to areas such as:
- Asset and agent management
- Policy configuration
- Event and alarm handling
- System settings

Proper role assignment is critical
to maintaining platform security and integrity.

---

## 8.4 System Settings

System settings control global platform behavior
and operational parameters.

These settings may include:
- General system configuration
- Network and enterprise definitions
- Integration and communication parameters
- Platform behavior preferences

Changes to system settings should be performed carefully
and documented as part of operational change management.

---

## 8.5 License Management

The platform provides visibility into
license status and entitlement information.

Administrators can:
- View active licenses
- Monitor usage against entitlements
- Identify license-related limitations

License information helps ensure
continued platform functionality
and compliance with licensing terms.

---

## 8.6 Audit and Logging

Administrative actions performed within the platform
are recorded for audit and traceability purposes.

Audit logs may include:
- User authentication activity
- Configuration changes
- Policy updates
- Administrative actions

Auditability supports compliance,
incident investigation,
and operational accountability.

---

## 8.7 Notification and Alerting Settings

Administrators may configure
how notifications and alerts are handled.

This can include:
- Alert visibility preferences
- Notification thresholds
- Integration with external notification mechanisms

Proper alert configuration helps ensure
that critical information reaches the right personnel
without generating unnecessary noise.

---

## 8.8 Platform Maintenance Considerations

Administrative users are responsible
for maintaining platform stability and availability.

Recommended practices include:
- Periodic review of system settings
- Regular verification of user access
- Monitoring administrative audit logs
- Coordinating changes through approved procedures

These practices help ensure
consistent and reliable platform operation.

---

## 8.9 Best Practices for Administration

To maintain a secure and well-governed environment,
the following practices are recommended:

- Limit administrative access to essential personnel
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Review user roles periodically
- Document significant configuration changes
- Monitor audit logs for unexpected activity

Following these practices reduces operational risk
and supports long-term platform reliability.
